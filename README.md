# Stock-Analysis
School project. Previously using requests module now yfinance to scrape and work Yahoo Finance for historical price data for different symbols. 
Will create separate text files containing historical data for the program to use in calculations. Both versions will give basic fundamental and technical analytics. 
Market_Viewer has a GUI, stock_analysis simply prompts the user in terminal.

Market_Viewer which depends on yfinance is currently limited by a bug with yfinance which sadly causes it not to be able to parse fundamental data.
